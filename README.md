# Ancient Messages

Mr. Renzo Panino, renowned as the chief architect of _Arditopia_, the largest city on Mars, was an exceptional figure and one of the greatest innovators of the 22nd century. This renowned polymath was also known for his involvement in DIANA during his younger years, leading the team during the endeavor for colonizing the planet. This experience significantly shaped his vision of Mars' future.

His achievements marked a true revolution. Renzo Panino was the creative genius behind the first Martian city, realizing his dream of a society settled on the volcanic plateau of Olympus Mons. However, his role in modern society is not without controversy. The Olympus Mons Society harbors deep resentment toward rovers, as in the early years of the Martian era they caused many fatal accidents. Renzo Panino, on the other hand, retained for all his life a special affection for rovers and this led to constant conflict with the dominant forces, which ultimately led to him being murdered by a No-Rover activist in a never fully explained scene.

On his death bed, Renzo told to Enzo, his beloved son, about a secret message he hid beneath the foundations of _Arditopia_, one message that should be revealed only when the city would be ready for it. 

So, Mr. Enzo embarked on a years-long quest, searching for the secret message. He traversed radioactive deserts, deadly jungles and frozen oceans on every corner of Mars. In the end, he found a little passage digging through the depth of the Olympus Mons. He adventured past the entrance, but never got out. 

Will you be able to find out why and to recover the important message Renzo left to all of us?
